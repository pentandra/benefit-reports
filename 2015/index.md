# Letter from our co-founders

A while back we faced a great decision: do we take the path to the right, which
looks well-traveled, with verdant grass and colorful flowers, or do we take the
one to the right, that looks a little treacherous, hazy, but with a feeling of
a much greater fulfillment that awaits at the end of it?

Such are the roads that have led to where we are now. Since writing about [a
social business](/blog/a-social-business/), we have gone down many such roads
in our minds, evaluated who we want to be, and how we could position ourselves
to get there. The decision for us has been hard. We've had to deeply analyze
our motivations for going into business this way, and ask ourselves whether we
are truly committed to this cause.

We can now say that we are ready to move forward.
