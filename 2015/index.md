# Letter from the co-founders

A while back we faced a great decision: do we take the path to the right, which
looks well-traveled, with verdant grass and colorful flowers, or do we take the
one to the right, that looks a little treacherous, hazy, but with the feeling
of a much greater fulfillment that awaits at the end of it?

Such are the roads that have led to where we are now, and the roads that lay
before us. Since writing about [a social business](/blog/a-social-business/),
we have gone down many such roads in our minds, evaluated who we want to be,
and how we could position ourselves to get there. The decision for us has been
hard. We've had to deeply analyze our motivations for going into business this
way, and ask ourselves whether we are truly committed to this cause.

We can now say that we are ready to move forward.
